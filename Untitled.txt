	1	-Read or write bit
	A242	-Virtual memory address
	21412	-Integer to write into memory
	0	-Read or write bit
	B321	-Virtual memory address to read integer

	*R/W Bit is determined by a 0/1 respectivly.

Usage: 
All commands were run in terminal within the directory the files exists.

Compile within a terminal with the following commands

	javac Main.java

Run within a terminal with the following commands

	java Main

Input file name to process simulation with.
